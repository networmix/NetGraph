## Example 1: Simple Data Center

A basic leaf-spine topology with traffic analysis.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    leaf:
      count: 4
      template: "leaf{n}"
      attrs:
        role: leaf
    spine:
      count: 2
      template: "spine{n}"
      attrs:
        role: spine
  links:
    - source: /leaf
      target: /spine
      pattern: mesh
      capacity: 100
      cost: 1

demands:
  default:
    - source: "^leaf/.*"
      target: "^leaf/.*"
      volume: 50
      mode: pairwise

failures:
  single_link:
    modes:
      - weight: 1.0
        rules:
          - scope: link
            mode: choice
            count: 1

workflow:
  - type: TrafficMatrixPlacement
    name: placement
    demand_set: default
    failure_policy: single_link
    iterations: 100
```

**Result**: 6 nodes (4 leaf + 2 spine), 8 links (4x2 mesh)

## Example 2: Multi-Pod with Blueprint

## Example 13: YAML Anchors for Reuse

Using `vars` section for DRY configuration.

```yaml
vars:
  default_link: &link_cfg
    capacity: 100
    cost: 1
  spine_attrs: &spine_attrs
    role: spine
    tier: 2
  leaf_attrs: &leaf_attrs
    role: leaf
    tier: 1

network:
  nodes:
    spine:
      count: 2
      template: "spine{n}"
      attrs:
        <<: *spine_attrs             # Merge anchor
        region: east

    leaf:
      count: 4
      template: "leaf{n}"
      attrs:
        <<: *leaf_attrs
        region: east

  links:
    - source: /leaf
      target: /spine
      pattern: mesh
      <<: *link_cfg                # Reuse link config
      attrs:
        link_type: fabric
```

**Result**: Anchors resolved during YAML parsing; cleaner, less repetitive config

## Example 14: One-to-One Pattern and Zip Expansion

Demonstrating pairwise connectivity patterns.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    # 4 servers, 2 switches - compatible for one_to_one (4 is multiple of 2)
    server[1-4]:
      count: 1
      template: "srv"
    switch[1-2]:
      count: 1
      template: "sw"

  links:
    # one_to_one: server1->switch1, server2->switch2, server3->switch1, server4->switch2
    - source: /server
      target: /switch
      pattern: one_to_one
      capacity: 100

    # zip expansion: pairs variables by index (equal-length lists required)
    - source: "server${idx}"
      target: "switch${sw}"
      expand:
        vars:
          idx: [1, 2]
          sw: [1, 2]
        mode: zip            # server1->switch1, server2->switch2
      pattern: one_to_one
      capacity: 50
      cost: 2
```

**Result**: Demonstrates one_to_one modulo wrap and zip expansion mode

        group_by: dc
      target:
        group_by: dc
      volume: 100
      mode: pairwise
      group_mode: per_group          # Separate demand per group pair
      priority: 1
      demand_placed: 10.0            # 10 units pre-placed
      flow_policy: SHORTEST_PATHS_WCMP
```

**Result**: Shows variable expansion in demands, group_mode, priority, demand_placed

## Example 16: Hierarchical Risk Groups

Nested risk group structure with children.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    rack1_srv1: {risk_groups: [Rack1_Card1]}
    rack1_srv2: {risk_groups: [Rack1_Card1]}
    rack1_srv3: {risk_groups: [Rack1_Card2]}
    rack2_srv1: {risk_groups: [Rack2]}
  links:
    - {source: rack1_srv1, target: rack2_srv1, capacity: 100}
    - {source: rack1_srv2, target: rack2_srv1, capacity: 100}
    - {source: rack1_srv3, target: rack2_srv1, capacity: 100}

risk_groups:
  - name: Rack1
    attrs: {location: "DC1-Row1"}
    children:
      - name: Rack1_Card1
        attrs: {slot: 1}
      - name: Rack1_Card2
        attrs: {slot: 2}
  - name: Rack2
    disabled: false
    attrs: {location: "DC1-Row2"}

failures:
  hierarchical:
    expand_groups: true
    expand_children: true   # Failing Rack1 also fails Card1, Card2
    modes:
      - weight: 1.0
        rules:
          - scope: risk_group
            mode: choice
            count: 1
            match:
              conditions:
                - attr: location
                  op: contains    # String contains
                  value: "DC1"
```

**Result**: Hierarchical risk groups with recursive child failure expansion

## Example 17: Risk Group Membership Rules

Dynamically assign entities based on attributes.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    core1: {attrs: {role: core, tier: 3, datacenter: dc1}}
    core2: {attrs: {role: core, tier: 3, datacenter: dc2}}
    edge1: {attrs: {role: edge, tier: 1, datacenter: dc1}}
    edge2: {attrs: {role: edge, tier: 1, datacenter: dc2}}
  links:
    - source: core1
      target: core2
      capacity: 1000
      attrs:
        route_type: backbone
        path_id: primary
    - source: core1
      target: edge1
      capacity: 400

risk_groups:
  # Assign all core tier-3 nodes
  - name: CoreTier3
    membership:
      scope: node
      match:
        logic: and              # Must match ALL conditions
        conditions:
          - attr: role
            op: "=="
            value: core
          - attr: tier
            op: "=="
            value: 3

  # Assign links by route type
  - name: BackboneLinks
    membership:
      scope: link
      match:
        logic: and
        conditions:
          - attr: route_type      # Dot-notation for nested attrs
            op: "=="
            value: backbone

  # String shorthand for simple groups
  - "ManualGroup1"
```

**Result**: Nodes and links automatically assigned to risk groups based on attributes

## Example 18: Generated Risk Groups

Create risk groups from unique attribute values.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    srv1: {attrs: {datacenter: dc1, rack: r1}}
    srv2: {attrs: {datacenter: dc1, rack: r2}}
    srv3: {attrs: {datacenter: dc2, rack: r1}}
  links:
    - source: srv1
      target: srv2
      capacity: 100
      attrs:
        connection_type: intra_dc
    - source: srv2
      target: srv3
      capacity: 100
      attrs:
        connection_type: inter_dc

risk_groups:
  # Generate risk group per datacenter (from nodes)
  - generate:
      scope: node
      group_by: datacenter
      name: "DC_${value}"
      attrs:
        generated: true
        type: location

  # Generate risk group per rack (from nodes)
  - generate:
      scope: node
      group_by: rack
      name: "Rack_${value}"

  # Generate risk group per connection type (from links)
  - generate:
      scope: link
      group_by: connection_type
      name: "Links_${value}"
```

**Result**: Creates 6 risk groups:

- `DC_dc1` (srv1, srv2)
- `DC_dc2` (srv3)
- `Rack_r1` (srv1, srv3)
- `Rack_r2` (srv2)
- `Links_intra_dc` (link srv1→srv2)
- `Links_inter_dc` (link srv2→srv3)

## Example 19: Additional Selector Operators

Demonstrating all condition operators.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    srv1: {attrs: {tier: 1, tags: [prod, web], region: null}}
    srv2: {attrs: {tier: 2, tags: [prod, db], region: east}}
    srv3: {attrs: {tier: 3, tags: [dev], region: west}}
    srv4: {attrs: {tier: 2}}
  links:
    - {source: srv1, target: srv2, capacity: 100}
    - {source: srv2, target: srv3, capacity: 100}
    - {source: srv3, target: srv4, capacity: 100}

demands:
  filtered:
    # Tier comparison operators
    - source:
        match:
          conditions:
            - attr: tier
              op: ">="
              value: 2
      target:
        match:
          conditions:
            - attr: tier
              op: "<"
              value: 3
      volume: 50
      mode: pairwise

    # List membership operators
    - source:
        match:
          conditions:
            - attr: region
              op: in
              value: [east, west]
      target:
        match:
          conditions:
            - attr: tags
              op: contains     # List contains value
              value: prod
      volume: 25
      mode: combine

    # Existence operators
    - source:
        match:
          conditions:
            - attr: region
              op: exists       # Attribute exists and not null
      target:
        match:
          conditions:
            - attr: region
              op: not_exists   # Attribute missing or null
      volume: 10
      mode: pairwise
```

**Result**: Demonstrates `>=`, `<`, `in`, `contains`, `exists`, `not_exists` operators

## Example 20: link_match and Rule Expansion

Using `link_match` to filter link rules by the link's own attributes, and `expand` for variable-based rule application.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    dc1_srv: {}
    dc2_srv: {}
    dc3_srv: {}
  links:
    - {source: dc1_srv, target: dc2_srv, capacity: 100, cost: 1, attrs: {type: fiber}}
    - {source: dc1_srv, target: dc2_srv, capacity: 500, cost: 1, attrs: {type: fiber}}
    - {source: dc2_srv, target: dc3_srv, capacity: 500, cost: 1, attrs: {type: copper}}

  # Update only high-capacity fiber links
  link_rules:
    - source: ".*"
      target: ".*"
      link_match:
        logic: and
        conditions:
          - {attr: capacity, op: ">=", value: 400}
          - {attr: type, op: "==", value: fiber}
      cost: 99
      attrs:
        priority: high

  # Apply node rules using variable expansion
  node_rules:
    - path: "${dc}_srv"
      expand:
        vars:
          dc: [dc1, dc2]
        mode: cartesian
      attrs:
        tagged: true
```

**Result**: Only the 500-capacity fiber link (dc1_srv -> dc2_srv) gets cost 99. Nodes dc1_srv and dc2_srv are tagged.

## Example 21: Nested Inline Nodes (No Blueprint)

Creating hierarchical topology structure without using blueprints.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    datacenter:
      attrs:
        region: west
        tier: 1
      nodes:
        rack1:
          attrs:
            rack_id: 1
          nodes:
            tor:
              count: 1
              template: "sw{n}"
              attrs:
                role: switch
            servers:
              count: 4
              template: "srv{n}"
              attrs:
                role: compute
        rack2:
          attrs:
            rack_id: 2
          nodes:
            tor:
              count: 1
              template: "sw{n}"
              attrs:
                role: switch
            servers:
              count: 4
              template: "srv{n}"
              attrs:
                role: compute

  links:
    # Connect servers to their TOR switch in each rack
    - source:
        path: "datacenter/rack1/servers"
      target:
        path: "datacenter/rack1/tor"
      pattern: mesh
      capacity: 25
    - source:
        path: "datacenter/rack2/servers"
      target:
        path: "datacenter/rack2/tor"
      pattern: mesh
      capacity: 25
    # Connect TOR switches
    - source: datacenter/rack1/tor/sw1
      target: datacenter/rack2/tor/sw1
      capacity: 100
```

**Result**: Creates 10 nodes (2 switches + 8 servers) in a two-rack hierarchy. All nodes inherit `region: west` and `tier: 1` from the datacenter parent. Each rack's nodes get the appropriate `rack_id`.

## Example 22: path Filter in Generate Blocks

Using `path` to narrow entities before generating risk groups.

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    prod_web1: {attrs: {env: production, service: web}}
    prod_web2: {attrs: {env: production, service: web}}
    prod_db1: {attrs: {env: production, service: database}}
    dev_web1: {attrs: {env: development, service: web}}
    dev_db1: {attrs: {env: development, service: database}}
  links:
    - {source: prod_web1, target: prod_db1, capacity: 100, attrs: {link_type: internal}}
    - {source: prod_web2, target: prod_db1, capacity: 100, attrs: {link_type: internal}}
    - {source: dev_web1, target: dev_db1, capacity: 50, attrs: {link_type: internal}}

risk_groups:
  # Generate env-based risk groups only for production nodes
  - generate:
      scope: node
      path: "^prod_.*"
      group_by: env
      name: "Env_${value}"
      attrs:
        generated: true
        critical: true

  # Generate service-based risk groups for all nodes
  - generate:
      scope: node
      group_by: service
      name: "Service_${value}"

  # Generate link risk groups only for production links
  - generate:
      scope: link
      path: ".*prod.*"
      group_by: link_type
      name: "ProdLinks_${value}"

demands:
  baseline:
    - source: "^prod_web.*"
      target: "^prod_db.*"
      volume: 50
      mode: pairwise
      flow_policy: SHORTEST_PATHS_ECMP

failures:
  production_failure:
    expand_groups: true
    modes:
      - weight: 1.0
        rules:
          - scope: risk_group
            path: "^Env_.*"
            mode: choice
            count: 1
```

**Result**: Creates the following risk groups:

- `Env_production` (only production nodes due to path filter)
- `Service_web` (prod_web1, prod_web2, dev_web1)
- `Service_database` (prod_db1, dev_db1)
- `ProdLinks_internal` (only production links due to path filter)

Note: `Env_development` is NOT created because dev nodes don't match `^prod_.*`.
