This document describes the DSL for defining network scenarios in NetGraph. Scenarios are YAML files that describe network topology, traffic demands, and analysis workflows.

## Overview

A scenario file defines a complete network simulation including:

- **Network topology**: Nodes, links, and their relationships, as well as risk groups
- **Analysis configuration**: Traffic demands, failure policies, workflows
- **Reusable components**: Blueprints, hardware definitions

The DSL enables both simple direct definitions and complex hierarchical structures with templates and parameters.

## Top-Level Keys

```yaml
network:                 # Network topology (required)
blueprints:              # Reusable network templates
components:              # Hardware component library
risk_groups:             # Failure correlation groups
vars:                    # YAML anchors and variables for reuse
traffic_matrix_set:      # Traffic demand definitions
failure_policy_set:      # Failure simulation policies
workflow:                # Analysis execution steps
```

## `network` - Core Foundation

The only required section. Defines network topology through nodes and links.

**Basic Properties:**

```yaml
network:
  name: "NetworkName"     # Optional network identifier
  version: "1.0"          # Optional version
```

### Direct Node and Link Definitions

**Individual Nodes:**

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    SEA:
      attrs:
        coords: [47.6062, -122.3321]
        hw_type: "router_model_A"
    SFO:
      attrs:
        coords: [37.7749, -122.4194]
        hw_type: "router_model_B"
```

**Individual Links:**

```yaml
network:
  links:
    - source: SEA
      target: SFO
      link_params:
        capacity: 200
        cost: 6846
        attrs:
          distance_km: 1369.13
          media_type: "fiber"
```

### Group-Based Definitions

**Node Groups:**

```yaml
network:
  groups:
    servers:
      node_count: 4
      name_template: "server-{node_num}"
      attrs:
        role: "compute"
    switches:
      node_count: 2
      name_template: "sw-{node_num}"
      attrs:
        role: "network"
```

**Adjacency Rules:**

```yaml
network:
  adjacency:
    - source: /servers
      target: /switches
      pattern: "mesh"           # Connect every server to every switch
      link_params:
        capacity: 10
        cost: 1
    - source: /switches
      target: /switches
      pattern: "one_to_one"     # Connect switches pairwise
      link_params:
        capacity: 40
        cost: 1
```

**Connectivity Patterns:**

- `mesh`: Full connectivity between all source and target nodes
- `one_to_one`: Pairwise connections (requires compatible group sizes)

### Bracket Expansion

Create multiple similar groups using bracket notation:

```yaml
network:
  groups:
    dc[1-3]/rack[a-b]:     # Creates dc1/racka, dc1/rackb, dc2/racka, etc.
      node_count: 4
      name_template: "srv-{node_num}"
```

**Expansion Types:**

- Numeric ranges: `[1-4]` â†’ 1, 2, 3, 4
- Character ranges: `[a-c]` â†’ a, b, c
- Explicit lists: `[red,blue,green]` â†’ red, blue, green

### Variable Expansion in Adjacency

```yaml
adjacency:
  - source: "plane{p}/rack{r}"
    target: "spine{s}"
    expand_vars:
      p: [1, 2]
      r: ["a", "b"]
      s: [1, 2, 3]
    expansion_mode: "cartesian"  # All combinations
    pattern: "mesh"

  - source: "server{idx}"
    target: "switch{idx}"
    expand_vars:
      idx: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    expansion_mode: "zip"        # Paired by index
    pattern: "one_to_one"
```

## `blueprints` - Reusable Templates

Templates for network segments that can be instantiated multiple times:

```yaml
blueprints:
  leaf_spine:
    groups:
      leaf:
        node_count: 4
        name_template: "leaf-{node_num}"
      spine:
        node_count: 2
        name_template: "spine-{node_num}"
    adjacency:
      - source: /leaf
        target: /spine
        pattern: mesh
        link_params:
          capacity: 40
          cost: 1

network:
  groups:
    pod1:
      use_blueprint: leaf_spine
    pod2:
      use_blueprint: leaf_spine
      parameters:                # Override blueprint parameters
        leaf.node_count: 6
        spine.name_template: "core-{node_num}"
```

**Blueprint Features:**

- Define groups and adjacency rules once, reuse multiple times
- Override parameters using dot notation during instantiation
- Hierarchical naming: `pod1/leaf/leaf-1`, `pod2/spine/core-1`

## Node and Link Overrides

Modify specific nodes or links after initial creation:

```yaml
network:
  node_overrides:
    - path: "^pod1/spine/.*$"           # Regex pattern matching
      disabled: true
      attrs:
        maintenance_mode: "active"
    - path: "server-[1-3]$"             # Specific node subset
      attrs:
        priority: "high"

  link_overrides:
    - source: "^pod1/leaf/.*$"
      target: "^pod1/spine/.*$"
      capacity: 100                     # Override capacity
    - source: ".*/spine/.*"
      target: ".*/spine/.*"
      any_direction: true               # Bidirectional matching
      link_params:
        cost: 5
        attrs:
          link_type: "backbone"
```

## `components` - Hardware Library

Define hardware components with attributes for cost and power modeling:

```yaml
components:
  SpineRouter:
    component_type: "chassis"
    cost: 50000.0
    power_watts: 2500.0
    capacity: 64000.0           # Gbps
    ports: 64
    attrs:
      vendor: "VendorName"
      model: "Model-9000"
    children:
      LineCard400G:
        component_type: "linecard"
        cost: 8000.0
        power_watts: 400.0
        capacity: 12800.0
        ports: 32
        count: 4

  Optic400G:
    component_type: "optic"
    cost: 2500.0
    power_watts: 12.0
    capacity: 400.0
    attrs:
      reach: "10km"
      wavelength: "1310nm"
```

**Component Usage:**

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    spine-1:
      attrs:
        hw_component: "SpineRouter"
  links:
    - source: spine-1
      target: leaf-1
      link_params:
        attrs:
          hw_component: "Optic400G"
```

## `risk_groups` - Hardware Risk Modeling

Define hierarchical failure correlation groups:

```yaml
risk_groups:
  - name: "Rack1"
    attrs:
      location: "DC1_Floor2"
    children:
      - name: "Card1.1"
        children:
          - name: "PortGroup1.1.1"
      - name: "Card1.2"
  - name: "PowerSupplyA"
    attrs:
      type: "power_infrastructure"
```

Nodes and links reference risk groups via `risk_groups` attribute:

```yaml
network:
  nodes:
    server-1:
      risk_groups: ["Rack1"]
      attrs:
        hw_component: "ServerChassis"
```

## `vars` - YAML Anchors

Defines reusable values using YAML anchors (`&name`) and aliases (`*name`) for deduplicating complex scenarios:

```yaml
vars:
  default_cap: &cap 10000
  base_attrs: &attrs {cost: 100, region: "dc1"}
  spine_config: &spine_cfg
    hw_component: "SpineRouter"
    power_budget: 2500

network:
  nodes:
    spine-1: {attrs: {<<: *attrs, <<: *spine_cfg, capacity: *cap}}
    spine-2: {attrs: {<<: *attrs, <<: *spine_cfg, capacity: *cap, region: "dc2"}}
```

**Anchor Types:**

- **Scalar**: `&cap 10000` - Reference primitive values
- **Mapping**: `&attrs {cost: 100}` - Reference objects
- **Merge**: `<<: *attrs` - Merge properties with override capability

**Processing Behavior:**

- Anchors are resolved during YAML parsing, before schema validation
- The `vars` section itself is ignored by NetGraph runtime logic
- Anchors can be defined in any section, not just `vars`
- Merge operations follow YAML 1.1 semantics (later keys override earlier ones)

## `traffic_matrix_set` - Traffic Analysis

Define traffic demand patterns for capacity analysis:

```yaml
traffic_matrix_set:
  production:
    - name: "server_to_storage"
      source_path: "^servers/.*"
      sink_path: "^storage/.*"
      demand: 1000               # Traffic volume
      mode: "combine"            # Aggregate demand
      priority: 1
      flow_policy_config: "SHORTEST_PATHS_ECMP"

    - name: "inter_dc_backup"
      source_path: "^dc1/.*"
      sink_path: "^dc2/.*"
      demand: 500
      mode: "full_mesh"          # Distributed demand
      priority: 2
```

**Traffic Modes:**

- `combine`: Single aggregate flow between source and sink groups
- `full_mesh`: Individual flows between all source-sink node pairs

**Flow Policies:**

- `SHORTEST_PATHS_ECMP`: Equal-cost multi-path routing
- `SHORTEST_PATHS_UCMP`: Unequal-cost multi-path routing
- `TE_ECMP_16_LSP`: Traffic engineering with 16 ECMP LSPs

## `failure_policy_set` - Failure Simulation

Define failure policies for resilience testing:

```yaml
failure_policy_set:
  single_link_failure:
    rules:
      - entity_scope: "link"
        rule_type: "choice"
        count: 1

  random_failures:
    fail_risk_groups: true
    use_cache: true
    rules:
      - entity_scope: "node"
        rule_type: "random"
        probability: 0.001
      - entity_scope: "link"
        rule_type: "random"
        probability: 0.002

  maintenance_scenario:
    rules:
      - entity_scope: "node"
        conditions:
          - attr: "maintenance_mode"
            operator: "=="
            value: "scheduled"
        rule_type: "all"
```

**Rule Types:**

- `all`: Select all matching entities
- `choice`: Select specific count of entities
- `random`: Select entities with given probability

**Conditions:**

- Target entities based on attributes
- Support operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `contains`, `not_contains`

## `workflow` - Execution Steps

Define analysis workflow steps:

```yaml
workflow:
  - step_type: BuildGraph
  - step_type: CapacityEnvelopeAnalysis
    name: "capacity_analysis"
    source_path: "^servers/.*"
    sink_path: "^storage/.*"
    mode: "combine"
    failure_policy: "single_link_failure"
    iterations: 1000
    parallelism: 4
    baseline: true
```

**Common Steps:**

- `BuildGraph`: Build network graph for analysis
- `NetworkStats`: Compute network statistics
- `CapacityEnvelopeAnalysis`: Monte Carlo capacity analysis

## Path Matching Regex Syntax

NetGraph uses Python regex patterns for node/link selection. Patterns are anchored at the start using `re.match()`.

**Pattern Examples:**

```yaml
# Exact match
path: "spine-1"

# Prefix match
path: "dc1/spine/"

# Wildcard patterns
path: "dc1/leaf.*"

# Anchored patterns
path: "^dc1/spine/switch-[1-3]$"

# Alternation
path: "^dc1/(spine|leaf)/.*$"
```

**Capturing Groups:**

Regex capturing groups create node groupings for analysis:

```yaml
# Single group: (dc\d+)
# Creates groups: "dc1", "dc2", etc.

# Multiple groups: (dc\d+)/(spine|leaf)/switch-(\d+)
# Creates groups: "dc1|spine|1", "dc1|leaf|2", etc.
```

**Group Behavior:**

- Single capturing group: Group by captured value
- Multiple capturing groups: Join with `|` separator
- No capturing groups: Group by original pattern string
