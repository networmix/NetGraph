# NetGraph

ðŸš§ Work in progress! ðŸš§

[![Python-test](https://github.com/networmix/NetGraph/actions/workflows/python-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/networmix/NetGraph/actions/workflows/python-test.yml)

NetGraph is a scenario-based network modeling and analysis framework written in Python. It allows you to design, simulate, and evaluate complex network topologies - ranging from small test cases to massive Data Center fabrics and WAN networks.

You can load an entire scenario from a single YAML file (including topology, failure policies, traffic demands, multi-step workflows) and run it in just a few lines of Python. The results can then be explored, visualized, and refined â€” making NetGraph well-suited for iterative network design, traffic engineering experiments, and what-if scenario analysis in large-scale topologies.

## Key Features

- **Scenario-Based Modeling**: Define complete network scenarios in YAML with topology, failures, traffic, and workflows
- **Hierarchical Blueprints**: Reusable network templates with nested structures and bracket expansion
- **Flow Analysis**: Calculate max flows, shortest paths, and capacity with ECMP/UCMP support
- **Failure Simulation**: Model component failures and risk groups for availability analysis
- **Traffic Engineering**: Define traffic demands with various placement policies
- **Rich Visualization**: Explore network topology and analyze results interactively

## Quick Start

Install NetGraph using pip:

```bash
pip install ngraph
```

Create and run a simple scenario:

```python
from ngraph.scenario import Scenario

scenario_yaml = """
network:
  groups:
    servers:
      node_count: 4
      name_template: "server-{node_num}"
    switches:
      node_count: 2  
      name_template: "switch-{node_num}"
  adjacency:
    - source: /servers
      target: /switches
      pattern: mesh
"""

scenario = Scenario.from_yaml(scenario_yaml)
network = scenario.network
print(f"Network has {len(network.nodes)} nodes and {len(network.links)} links")
```
