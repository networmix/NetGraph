    Compute shortest paths (and their costs) from a source node using Dijkstra's algorithm.

    This function implements a single-source shortest-path (Dijkstraâ€™s) algorithm
    that can optionally allow multiple equal-cost paths to the same destination
    if ``multipath=True``. It uses a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve
    the next closest node to expand. Excluded edges or excluded nodes can be
    supplied to remove them from path consideration.

    Args:
        graph: The directed graph (StrictMultiDiGraph) on which to run SPF.
        src_node: The source node from which to compute shortest paths.
        edge_select_func: A function that, given the graph, current node, neighbor node,
            a dictionary of edges, the set of excluded edges, and the set of excluded nodes,
            returns a tuple of (cost, list_of_edges) representing the minimal edge cost
            and the edges to use.
            Defaults to an edge selection function that finds edges with the minimal cost.
        multipath: If True, multiple paths with the same cost to the same node are recorded.
        excluded_edges: An optional set of edges (by EdgeID) to exclude from the graph.
        excluded_nodes: An optional set of nodes (by NodeID) to exclude from the graph.

    Returns:
        A tuple of:
            - costs: A dictionary mapping each reachable node to the cost of the shortest path
              from ``src_node`` to that node.
            - pred: A dictionary mapping each reachable node to another dictionary. The inner
              dictionary maps a predecessor node to the list of edges taken from the predecessor
              to the key node. Multiple predecessors may be stored if ``multipath=True``.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If ``src_node`` is not present in ``graph``.

    Examples:
        >>> costs, pred = spf(my_graph, src_node="A")
        >>> print(costs)
        {"A": 0, "B": 2.5, "C": 3.2}
        >>> print(pred)
        {
            "A": {},
            "B": {"A": [("A", "B")]},
            "C": {"B": [("B", "C")]}
