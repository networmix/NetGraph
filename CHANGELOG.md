### Added

- **AnalysisContext API**: `analyze()` now returns an `AnalysisContext` for max-flow, shortest paths, and sensitivity analysis with reusable state.

### Changed

- **Performance runner & workflows**: Reuse bound `AnalysisContext` to avoid rebuilding Core graphs across repeated analyses.
- **Docs & examples**: Updated guides and reference docs to describe the new analysis API and bound-context workflow.
- **Failure handling**: More consistent tracking of disabled nodes and links during analysis.
